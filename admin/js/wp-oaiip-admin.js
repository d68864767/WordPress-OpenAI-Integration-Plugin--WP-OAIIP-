	/**
	 * All of the code for your admin-facing JavaScript source
	 * should reside in this file.
	 *
	 * Note: It has been assumed you will write jQuery code here, so the
	 * $ function reference has been prepared for use within the scope of
	 * this function.
	 *
	 * This enables you to define handlers, for when the DOM is ready:
	 *
	 * $(function() {
	 *
	 * });
	 *
	 * When the window is loaded:
	 *
	 * $( window ).load(function() {
	 *
	 * });
	 *
	 * ...and/or other possibilities.
	 *
	 * Ideally, it is not considered best practice to attach more than a
	 * single DOM-ready or window-load handler for a particular page.
	 * Although scripts in the WordPress core, Plugins and Themes may be
	 * acting on this event, so we recommend the following best practice:
	 *
	 * jQuery( document ).ready( function() {
	 *
	 * });
	 *
	 * @link       https://www.yourwebsite.com
	 * @since      1.0.0
	 *
	 * @package    WP_OAIIP
	 * @subpackage WP_OAIIP/admin/js
